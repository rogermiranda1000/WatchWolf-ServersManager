# WatchWolf - ServersManager
## Debug integration

Here you'll find all the required files to build&run WW-ServersManager providing locally-compiled dependencies (WW-ServersManager and WW-Server's jar files).

#### Build

To build the docker, you can run the `build.sh --preclean` file.

Aditionally, you can specify how many threads should the build use with the `--threads <num_threads>` argument.

REVISIT: you'll require to have Maven installed: `sudo apt-get install maven`

#### Run

Run the built docker using the `run.sh` script.
